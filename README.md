# Predicting-price-of-house-with-machine-learning-in-python
#Around the World,real estate sector is exposed to wide fluctuations in prices because of existing correlations with so many features, either known or unknown. Based on market and non-market risks, housing prices can increase or decrease at varying rate in a given period of time. In this project, it is aimed at developing a machine learning application that would identify better price predictions for housing properties to facilitate sellers/buyers to make worthy investment in the real estate properties.

#Conclusion
#We trained numerous regression models on cleaned, preprocessed train data (e.g., simple linear regression, lasso, ridge, KNN, Support vector regressor-SVR, Decision tree regressor-DT) and evaluate their performance using R-square,Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), MSE, MAE on the test data. The best performance is given by ensembled Gradient boosting model with Lowest RMSE,Highest R-square,Best computation speed,Realistic Feature Importance. The top key features driving the price of the property: 'furnished_1', 'yr_built', 'living_measure','quality_8', 'HouseLandRatio','lot_measure15', 'quality_9', 'ceil_measure', 'total_area'.
